My local setup.

## system_bootstap.sh

The repository includes a collection of scripts I've written for
bootstrapping a Fedora Workstation install. You can find them in
the `system/` directory.

`system_bootstrap.sh` serves as an entrypoint and can be launched via
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thymelous/dotfiles/master/system_bootstrap.sh | bash`.
